class KGCorrelation(treecorr.BinnedCorr2):
    """This class handles the calculation and storage of a 2-point kappa-shear correlation
    function.

    Ojects of this class holds the following attributes:

        :nbins:     The number of bins in logr
        :bin_size:  The size of the bins in logr
        :min_sep:   The minimum separation being considered
        :max_sep:   The maximum separation being considered

    In addition, the following attributes are numpy arrays of length (nbins):

        :logr:      The nominal center of the bin in log(r) (the natural logarithm of r).
        :rnom:      The nominal center of the bin converted to regular distance.
                    i.e. r = exp(logr).
        :meanr:     The (weighted) mean value of r for the pairs in each bin.
                    If there are no pairs in a bin, then exp(logr) will be used instead.
        :meanlogr:  The (weighted) mean value of log(r) for the pairs in each bin.
                    If there are no pairs in a bin, then logr will be used instead.
        :xi:        The correlation function, :math:`\\xi(r) = \\langle \\kappa \\gamma_T\\rangle`.
        :xi_im:     The imaginary part of :math:`\\xi(r)`.
        :varxi:     The variance of :math:`\\xi`, only including the shape noise propagated into the
                    final correlation.  This does not include sample variance, so it is always
                    an underestimate of the actual variance.
        :weight:    The total weight in each bin.
        :npairs:    The number of pairs going into each bin.

    If `sep_units` are given (either in the config dict or as a named kwarg) then the distances
    will all be in these units.  Note however, that if you separate out the steps of the
    :func:`process` command and use :func:`process_auto` and/or :func:`process_cross`, then the
    units will not be applied to :meanr: or :meanlogr: until the :func:`finalize` function is
    called.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows:

        >>> kg = treecorr.KGCorrelation(config)
        >>> kg.process(cat1,cat2)   # Calculate the cross-correlation
        >>> kg.write(file_name)     # Write out to a file.
        >>> xi = kg.xi              # Or access the correlation function directly.

    :param config:      A configuration dict that can be used to pass in kwargs if desired.
                        This dict is allowed to have addition entries in addition to those listed
                        in :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr2`, which are ignored here. (default: None)
    :param logger:      If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                        one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    See the documentation for :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr2` for the list of other allowed kwargs,
    which may be passed either directly or in the config dict.
